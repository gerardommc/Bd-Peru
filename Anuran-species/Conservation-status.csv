516369,135889,Telmatobius sanborni,Critically Endangered,A2ace+4ace,2020,2019-09-25 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Listed as Critically Endangered because of an observed and projected population decline of more than 80%, inferred from the effects of chytridiomycosis on this species.","The species lives along steep Andean slopes in the upper part of cloud forests, and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Polylepis</span> formations (De la Riva 2005). Adults are semi-aquatic and are found under stones and logs near rivers and small creeks. The tadpoles are found in rapid streams, where they adhere to rocks using their oral sucker (De la Riva 2005). It breeds by larval development in streams.","Local inhabitants' comments to I. De la Riva, in addition to extensive field work during&#160;2006-2007, are suggestive of a severe population decline at the Peruvian localities; the cause of which is not known. The chytrid-associated declines observed in other Andean frogs in Peru suggest that this could be a potential threat in this case, although this requires verification. In 1999–2001, specimens&#160;tested positive for the amphibian chytrid fungus,<em>&#160;Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</em>, in Bolivia&#160;(Burrowes and De la Riva 2017), suggesting that chytridiomycosis could also be a threat to the species in this country.<br/><br/>It is possible that the species may be utilized (I.

It also inhabits dry equatorial forests. It thrives in degraded habitats and man-made environments, and is occasionally found in pristine lowland and montane rainforests, but generally prefers open or disturbed habitat such as tracks, roads, low grassland and areas that are near human settlement, e.g. grazing land, suburban parks and gardens. It tends to avoid more densely vegetated areas (eg. wet sclerophyll and rainforest), which can then act as a barrier to their dispersal. It can be found by day beneath fallen trees, loose boards, matted coconut leaves, and similar cover (Lynn 1940). It feeds on arthropods (especially ants and termites) and small vertebrates. It is flexible regards breeding site (Evans <em>et al.</em> 1996); eggs and larvae develop in slow or still shallow waters of ponds, ditches, temporary pools, reservoirs, canals, and streams. Clutch size is between 8,000 and 17,000. Eggs and tadpoles are poisonous and displace native tadpoles. It may sometimes breed in slightly brackish water in Hawaii. Larvae are tolerant of high temperatures.","Overall, there are no significant threats to this very adaptable, invasive species. Introduced animals are carrying salmonella in Puerto Rico, putting other native species at risk. In some parts of its introduced range it competes with native frogs and has a negative impact on native wildlife that attempt to consume it.

It is restricted to marshy lakes, such as Lake Junín, smaller, deep, isolated lakes, as well as,&#160;streams, rivers, wetlands, and canals around Lake Junín (A. Watson and A. Fitzgerald pers. comm. February 2018). Ideal stream habitat characteristics of this frog are free of predatory, invasive rainbow trout with moderate levels of silt and relatively clean water&#160;(Watson 2017a). It reproduces by larval development. Tadpoles prefer microhabitats characterized with a silt-like substrate, depths of more than 30 cm,&#160;low currents, presence of native fish (<em>Orestias&#160;</em>spp.), and submerged vegetation<span style=""""> (Castillo 2017).&#160;In </span>a study on diet composition and prey selection, Watson <em>et al</em>. (2017b) found that&#160;the Junín Giant Frog&#160;appeared to select snails (family Physidae) and mayflies (family Baetidae) from the available prey in the environment.","The species is generally threatened by introduction of trout into lakes, streams, and rivers in the high Andes,&#160;disappearance of native fish of the genus <em>Orestias</em>,&#160;uncontrolled exploitation as a food source, emerging infectious diseases (chytridiomycosis and ranavirus), climate change,&#160;and&#160;loss of habitat through the extraction of resources, agricultural, industrial, and residential&#160;pollution, eutrophication, over-grazing by livestock, and fluctuations in water levels controlled by the Upamayo dam&#160;(Watson <em>et al.</em> 2017a,b). The cleaning of channelised streams, which involves the periodic removal of submerged aquatic vegetation and sediment, represents an additional threat to the species and its habitat&#160;(L. Castillo Roque pers. comm. February 2018). Large amounts of acid mine drainage and heavy metals, such as copper, zinc and lead, from the Cerro de Pasco region&#160;are discharged into the lake, and its surrounding lagoons and wetlands via the San Juan River, the lake's main tributary (Rodbell <em>et al</em>. 2014, Watson <em>et al</em>. 2017b). This is particularly damaging to this frog, due to its high sensitivity to contaminants and the high permeability of its skin.&#160;<br/><br/>Congeners in southern Peru have been infected with chytrid&#160;(Seimon<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2005, Catenazzi&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011), and one species in nearby Ecuador has disappeared, suggesting this species might also be at risk. In 2014, 14 samples&#160;tested negative&#160;for the presence of&#160;<em>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</em>&#160;(R. Elias pers. comm. March 2018), and&#160;there are no reports of the species being infected with this fungus as of yet (A. Catenazzi pers. comm. April 2017).","Previously common, <span style="""">this species has undergone a noticeable decline over the last thirty years. In 1996, there was a mass die-off in&#160;</span>Lake Junín and other water bodies of the&#160;Sierra Central, the cause of which is still uncertain (Becerra Díaz 2012).<br/><br/>While current population estimates are not available, the population is suspected to be decreasing due to ongoing decline in the quality and extent of its habitat, and there is continuing decline in mature individuals due to overexploitation. Linear transects and diving surveys in lagoons, rivers, streams, and channels in and around Lake Junín during&#160;October to December 2012 detected 12 individuals, however the species was present in only 10.76% of the 65 surveyed sites (Loza Del Carpio and Mendoza Quispe&#160;2017).&#160;During monthly surveys&#160;in&#160;three protected areas in Junín and Pasco between January 2015 and July 2016, adults and/or tadpoles were found in only eight out of twenty sites (Watson <em>et al.</em> 2017b).<br/><br/>The species appears to be restricted to water bodies with good water quality, and has not been recorded during recent surveys in the northern zone of Lake Junín where there are signs of contamination&#160;(Loza Del Carpio and Mendoza Quispe&#160;2017). According to surveys of local inhabitants in 2012, 95% of interviewees stated that they had directly observed this frog in their natural habitats at some point, however&#160;65% indicated that they last saw the frogs more than six years ago and only 10% saw this species as recent as in 2012&#160;(Loza Del Carpio and Mendoza Quispe&#160;2017).",Decreasing,"This species occurs in the Departments of Junín and Pasco, Peru.&#160;It has been recorded in Lake Junín and surrounding tributaries in the Junín National Reserve and Historical Sanctuary of Chacamarca, and tributaries to the Mantaro River in the National Sanctuary of Huayllay, Pasco. Between 2010 and 2011, attempts were made&#160;by the Regional Government of Junín&#160;to introduce this species into the upper Mantaro valley,&#160;in the central Andes of Junín, however its occurrence there is currently unknown and needs to be verified with surveys (O.J. Damian Baldeón&#160;pers. comm. February 2018). Within its native distribution, it has an elevational range of 4,000–4,600 m asl. Its extent of occurrence (EOO) is estimated to be 1,118 km<sup>2 </sup>and all individuals are considered to occur in less than five threat-defined locations.","Overexploitation is one of the strongest threats to this species and contributed significantly to its population decline; exploitation levels have reached a point such that it is difficult to find this species in the wild (Angulo 2008, Aguilar <em>et al</em>. 2010). As these frogs are becoming increasingly more difficult to find, hunting is no longer a normal activity; however, when the regular cleaning of channelised streams takes place, local inhabitants take advantage and harvest the displaced frogs (O.J. Damian Baldeón&#160;pers. comm. February 2018). The species is still sold in local markets (A. Watson pers. comm. February 2018). Based on surveys of local inhabitants in 2012, 95% of interviewees stated that they had consumed this species at some point and 55% stated that they had once captured frogs, mainly for self-consumption (87%) (Loza Del Carpio and Mendoza Quispe&#160;2017).",Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<strong><em>Conservation Actions</em></strong><strong><em><br/></em></strong>This species occurs in the Junín National Reserve, the Historic Sanctuary of Chacamarca, and the National Sanctuary of Huayllay (Watson <em>et al</em>. 2017b).&#160;An<em>&#160;in situ</em>&#160;frog monitoring and conservation education program called the “High-Andean Frog Conservation through Capacity-Building Program” funded by USAID Small Project Assistance grants was in place from 2014–2016 (S.

Breeding takes place in streams, where males call in groups of four to ten close to the water. Köhler (2000) observed this species perching at night 0.3–1.2 m above the ground, in vegetation in disturbed primary forest and secondary growth along roadsides. Occasionally, it can be found in disturbed forests, for example in the Serrania de Bella Vista, close to coffee plantations, small-scale agriculture and coca production (Reichle 2007, M. Pacheco pers. comm. 2020).","There is very little habitat loss taking place in Parque Nacional Bahuaja Sonene and Parque Nacional Manu in Peru. The disappearance of the species from Parque Nacional Manu took place during a period (mid- to late-1990s) when several species known to be susceptible to chytridiomycosis disappeared from streams in montane cloud forest, suggesting that an outbreak of this fungal disease played a role in these declines.&#160;The rapid, dramatic declines, including disappearances within undisturbed habitat, has been associated with chytridiomycosis as observed in many other montane, stream-associated species in the Andes. Predation by exotic trout or synergistic effects of multiple factors could have also played a role in the past declines (Bolivia Red List Assessment Workshop 2019).&#160;Samples collected in 1990–2003 in Bolivia were tested for the presence of chytridiomycosis and roughly one third of them – all of which were collected in 1999 at Sehuencas, Cochabamba – were positive for the fungus (Burrowes and De la Riva 2017).&#160;Other major threats to the species include habitat loss, due to small-holder farming activities for coffee, coca, and chili peppers, and pollution as a consequence of increased stream sedimentation.&#160;In addition, this species is expected to show limited climatic adaptability (Lötters 2007).","The species was always more abundant in the northern portion of its range, such as Serranía Eslabón and Serranía Bellavista in La Paz Department, Bolivia, compared to the southern part of its range, such as the&#160;Yungas of Cochabamba, where it was always considered rare (A. Muñoz pers. comm. 2020). It seems to be absent from apparently suitable areas of habitat, suggesting that drastic population declines have occurred in the past and/or are still occurring (De la Riva and Reichle 2014). It appears to have become relatively rare for unknown reasons (J.C. Chaparro pers. comm. in Lötters <em>et al</em>. 2005). The species had not been recorded from Serranía Bella Vista since several individuals were observed there in 2003, and targeted surveys in the same area in 2007 did not record any individuals (A. Muñoz pers. comm. 2020). Evidently, individuals were last seen in December 2003 in Parque Nacional Madidi (J.M. Padial pers. comm. In: De la Riva and Reichle 2014). Targeted surveys in Parque Nacional Carrasco in 2006 were unsuccessful in finding this species (A. Muñoz pers. comm. September 2019). Regular efforts to find subpopulations in Bolivia have been undertaken in the Yungas of La Paz and Cochabamba from 2009–2019, but despite several visits under suitable climatic conditions, researchers were unable to detect any individuals of this species (I. De la Riva, pers. obs.; R. Aguayo and O. Quinteros pers. comm.&#160;September&#160;2019). The species was not observed during the&#160;last visits to Serranía&#160;de Sadiri and Serranía&#160;del Tigre in 2007, where the last known reports from this area date back to 1969 (I. De la Riva pers. comm. September 2019).&#160;In January 2020, four individuals were observed and photographed in the&#160;Serranía Bella Vista, at a locality close to Caranavi, in a stream with good habitat, but surrounded by deforested areas (M. Pacheco pers. obs. 2020). This represents the first record of the species in Bolivia since 2003. The gorge where this species was recorded in the&#160;Serranía Bella Vista is part of a complex of three adjacent streams in a stretch of 200 m, and yet the species was only present in one of them, the most rocky and least accessible, suggesting this species has very specific habitat requirements; several other streams at the same elevation were also surveyed, but this species was apparently absent (M. Pacheco pers. obs. 2020).<br/><br/>Surveys in Cusco during 2007 and 2008 were unable to find any individuals after searching for a total of 40 person-days from 1,400–2,000 m asl (von May&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008). This species has not been seen in Parque Nacional Manu since 1999, despite intensive monitoring along streams where the frogs used to reproduce (Catenazzi and von May&#160;2014). Visual-encounter surveys in montane forests (1,200–3,700 m asl) along the Paucartambo–Shintuya road in Kosñipata Valley,&#160;Parque Nacional Manu&#160;were unable to detect this species in 1999, 2008 and 2009 (Catenazzi <em>et al</em>. 2011) and 2012–2016 (A. Catenazzi pers. comm. April 2017). Surveys took place in the Puno Department in the buffer zone and within the boundaries of Parque Nacional Bahuaja Sonene in November 2006, February-March and May-June 2007; just two individuals were recorded in February 2007 (J.C. Chaparro pers. comm. April 2018), however surveys in the area in 2016 failed to record the species (A. Catenazzi pers. comm.

At night, individuals perch on the upper surfaces of leaves over streams and during the day they rest on upper leaf surfaces over streams, where breeding occurs (Cadle and McDiarmid 1990). Breeding for this species apparently begins with the onset of rains (January). Males call from the upper surfaces of leaves 0.5–3 m above streams. Eggs are deposited on leaves above permanent and temporary streams, and larvae develop in the streams. Breeding activity (based on the number of observed egg masses in some stream sections) is believed to be high, compared to other species of the genus (Cadle and McDiarmid 1990).

Larval transport and free-swimming tadpoles of this species have been recorded in February (Duellman 2004).","Where this species has been recorded in the Huancabamba depression, it is threatened by deforestation and agricultural activities (mostly cultivation of potatoes).

It is however unknown whether this disease represents a specific threat to this species.

They are primarily found in the upper and lower portions of steep cliff faces, where they have easy access to surrounding vegetation to forage for food (J. Brown pers. comm. April 2017). They are largely absent from the interior of the cliff faces, which is thought to be due to the danger of foraging in the steep cliff faces (J. Brown pers. comm. April 2017). Breeding takes place only in bromeliads, which are the only stable and long-lasting water source in the immediate areas, particularly during the dry season (Schulte 1990,&#160;Papasera 2011). Males carry tadpoles on their backs and deposit each of them into tiny pools in a separate bromeliad cavity, where they complete development (Papasera 2011). The old-growth trees with <em>Aechmea </em>bromeliads on which this frog depends for reproduction, are very rare and have been mostly destroyed (Twomey and Brown 2009). Adult and juvenile frogs were observed to be feeding on ants and small, winged flies both inside the bromeliad and outside on rock walls, forest floor and on other plants&#160;(Papasera 2011).","The main threat is forest clearance for agricultural use (including coffee and banana cultivation,&#160;cattle ranching and timber trade) and human settlements (Twomey and Brown 2009, Aguirre 2011, Martinez <em>et al</em>. 2013). The species now survives in only five or six small patches of forest (Halliday 2016). Uncontrolled slash and burn agriculture is common and of particular concern as fires do not adhere to the boundaries of reserves (Pasapera 2011).&#160;Smuggling decimated the population in the late 1990's (Twomey and Brown 2009) and may still present a threat.","Much of the area is deforested and populations are only known from forest remnants that remain on some steep cliffs and slopes.

Some of the trees that host the bromeliads in which this frog lives are scattered in a mosaic of degraded environments, which confounds the status of the population and hinders the movement of individuals and genetic exchange (Schulte 1990).

Consequently, this is a somewhat common frog in Europe, completely of illegal origin, and the potential for local conservation projects based on the legal sale of this species is now severely compromised (Twomey and Brown 2009). In 2007, the authorities in charge of animal confiscations attempted to release two dozen confiscated individuals outside of Tarapoto (R.&#160;Schulte&#160;pers. comm. in: Brown <em>et al</em>. 2008).

While mainly found in under logs and large piles of leaves, frogs have also been found in open areas in the forest and in cleared areas near a tea plantation (Myers and Daly 1979), and other agricultural areas. It probably breeds throughout the year (Halliday 2016). Eggs are deposited in leaf-litter and guarded by males until they hatch, then he carries the larvae to streams or puddles for their development.&#160;The male holotype was found in November guarding a clutch of 30 eggs in a dry leaf (Myers and Daly 1979).","Much of this frog's habitat has been cleared for agricultural activities, including cattle pastures and tea farms (Twomey and Brown 2009).

In December 2016 near the town of Divisora, surveys of 9 person-hours encountered one adult, one sub-adult and several dozen tadpoles in water pools on a trail (J. Brown pers. comm. April 2017). This survey was conducted during heavy rainfall so no adult frogs would have been calling, therefore more individuals could have been present but could not be detected (J. Brown pers. comm.

Other specimens have been collected in an open and sandy desert, with scattered, low, desert vegetation, and trees that are absent except in or near temporary streambeds (Peters 1967).&#160;Although it can inhabit altered areas, like pastures and roadsides, it relies on nearby forest and is absent from completely deforested areas (D.F. Cisneros-Heredia pers. comm. 2016).&#160;<br/><br/>This species is active only during the rainy season (January–May), when individuals spend the days buried in the ground, and emerge during humid nights to feed and reproduce&#160;(Székely <em>et al.</em> 2018a,b). All breeding activity being concentrated in a few hours each year (Székely&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018a).&#160;For the rest of the year, the frogs remain buried in the ground in a dormant state, covered in a cocoon of dead skin layers that diminishes water loss. During the breeding season, individuals have been observed in and near to temporary ponds along a trail within forest, while subadults have been observed in a disturbed area with few trees and furrowed soil (Ortiz <em>et al</em>. 2013). The Pacific Horned Frog has a low age at maturity and a short reproductive life-span (2–3 years;&#160;Székely&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018a).","The major threat is habitat loss due to agriculture (especially cattle ranching), logging, and human settlement, particularly in the coastal dry forests of Ecuador. Soil pollution, due to agrochemicals, also represents a threat. Specifically within&#160;Bosque Protector Cerro Prosperina de Guayaquil, human expansion (informal settlements on the slopes of the mountain), forest fires, agriculture and roadkill caused by vehicles on the trails are threats to this species (Amador and Brito 2013). The total area&#160;occupied&#160;by Arenillas Ecological Reserve has been decreasing continuously, from 17.08 ha in 1994 to 14.28 ha in 2001, and 10.27 ha in 2012 (Camacho and Ullauri 2013), caused by illegal logging and the ongoing expansion of shrimp farms and cultivated land within the protected area (Székely&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018b).&#160;A persistent drought of 2–3 consecutive years with low recruitment would endanger the survival of the whole population because of this species' short reproductive lifespan (Székely&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018b).&#160;This species is also threatened by harvesting from the wild for the pet trade.","It is a rare species.&#160;The entire population currently occurs in fewer than eight different subpopulations, which are severely fragmented and rather isolated from each other (D.F. Cisneros-Heredia pers. comm. 2016). The number of adult individuals is estimated to be less than 10,000 individuals, with each subpopulation having less than 1,000 individuals (Ecuador Red List Assessment Workshop July 2016).&#160;The number of mature individuals is suspected to be declining in Ecuador as a result of the destruction and fragmentation of coastal dry forests.<br/><br/>Three specimens were collected at Punto Los Piqueros (Minabí, Ecuador) in August 2000&#160;(Cisneros-Heredia 2006).&#160;Eight specimens were collected during March 1991 and January 1992 (Cisneros-Heredia 2006). Fourty-four adults and sub-adults were collected at Reserva Ecológica Militar Arenillas (REMA), El Oro province, Ecuador, between 31 January and 1 February 2007 (Ortiz<em> et al.</em> 2013). Three juveniles were collected in March 2011 at Destacamento Pintag Nuevo, REMA, (El Oro, Ecuador) in a marshy area and at the margin of a pond, close to human habitation (Ortiz<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2013). Four individuals were detected during surveys in Reserva Ecológia Comunal Loma Alta (Santa Elena, Ecuador) throughout 2005–2010 (Amador and Martínez 2011). In March 2012, one individual was observed within the&#160;Bosque Protector Cerro Prosperina de Guayaquil, Guayas, Ecuador (Amador and Brito 2013). A second individual, though deceased, was found during May 2012 surveys in the same area. Subsequent surveys during June 2012 were futile, likely because of the seasonal habits of this species (Amador and Brito 2013). Surveys carried out during the rainy season (January–May)&#160;in Arenillas Ecological Reserve observed 20 amplexed pairs served in 2015 over 38 fieldwork days and 29 pairs in 2016 over 65 fieldwork days (Székely&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018a).<br/><br/>There is no information on its population status in Peru.

This assessment needs to be qualified on the basis that the species' distribution is extremely poorly-known and the recognized threats are highly localized around the known localities. If this species is found to occur more widely within protected <em>puna</em> grasslands, it will therefore warrant listing in a less threatened category.","This terrestrial species appears to be confined to wet <em>puna</em><em> </em>grasslands and elfin forest habitats, and is not present in degraded areas. While it has been recorded from cloud forest within Manu, it is very rare in this habitat (A. Catenazzi pers. comm.&#160;February&#160;2011, April 2017). Males lack the vocal apparatus found in most frogs, and both sexes lack eardrums and internal ear structures (Halliday 2016). Breeding takes place by direct development. The female lays around 20 eggs in a nest of moss and guards them until they hatch into froglets, 6–7 mm long (Halliday 2016).","Grasslands along the western boundary of Manu National Park are being destroyed by the activities of smallholder farmers (A. Catenazzi pers. comm. February 2011, April 2017), and this may represent the major threat to this species. Cattle grazing may also destroy the bunchgrasses where this frog occurs (A. Catenazzi pers. comm. February 2011, April 2017). Fires set outside the reserve have also impacted the frog's habitat, and have destroyed at least one survey plot where the species was formerly abundant (A. Catenazzi pers. comm. February 2011, April 2017). These threats are however restricted to areas bordering the main road, and their impacts on the population are unclear even there (A. Catenazzi pers. comm. February 2011, April 2017). There is anecdotal evidence that the frequency of fires at one survey site is decreasing due to improved enforcement by park rangers, although this cannot be quantified (A. Catenazzi pers. comm.&#160;February&#160;2011, April 2017).&#160;<br/><br/>In 2009,&#160;the chytrid fungus&#160;<em>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</em>&#160;was detected in this species at Kosñipata Valley, Manu National Park,&#160;with a prevalence of&#160;25% (n=16)&#160;(Catenazzi&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011). Chytridiomycosis is the probable cause of severe population declines in amphibian assemblages of the upper&#160;Manu National Park&#160;(Catenazzi&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011), however, direct developing frogs such as this species are not likely to be affect by chytrid (A. Catenazzi pers. comm. April 2017).","This species can be very common where it occurs; exceptionally, 20 individuals were recorded from one 10 x 10 m plot in 1997 (A. Catenazzi pers. comm. February 2011,&#160;April 2017). The frog appears to be highly localized, being rare or absent in other surveys (A. Catenazzi pers. comm. February 2011,&#160;April 2017); for instance, being recorded only once from 10 litter plots sampled between 1974 and 1975 (Pefaur and Duellman 1980). This patchiness in the species' distribution makes it difficult to identify population trends. Surveys during 2007 and 2008 in the Region of Cusco detected 22 individuals over 25 person-days and 33 individuals over 28 person-days, respectively (von May <em>et al</em>. 2008). Repeated leaf litter surveys in Manu National Park recorded 60–70% fewer individuals overall in 2008 and 2009 than in 1997–1999 (Catenazzi <em>et al.</em> 2011); however, this includes the data from the plot with 20 individuals, which appears to have been an outlier and which was destroyed by fire in 2006 (A. Catenazzi pers. comm. March 2011,&#160;April 2017). This apparent decline may therefore be an artifact or the short-term consequence of a single stochastic event. In individual plots where this species was recorded, densities remained as high in 2008–2009 as in previous surveys (<em>e.g.</em>, 8–10 individuals per 10 x 10 m plot in 2007; A. Catenazzi pers. comm. February 2011,&#160;April 2017).

Gutiérrez pers. comm. on iNaturalist observation&#160;<a href=""http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/219132"">http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/219132</a>&#160;(Accessed: March 21, 2016)].&#160;At Acjanaco, it also occurs in the upper limits of cloud forest. Individuals have been found at night in a small pool, 50 cm deep, on rocks in a stream, and in puna on rocks, in crevices, on the ground, and in moss adjacent to streams. Reproduction is by larval development in streams.","Intense livestock farming, pasture burning and livestock-driven water pollution have been observed in the border area between Megantoni and Manu (R. Gutiérrez pers. comm. October 2013). Pasture burning and habitat disturbance impact stream riverbeds and increase erosion in certain areas, affecting the formation of breeding pools (R. Gutiérrez pers. comm. October 2013).&#160;<br/><br/>This species appears to have undergone rapid, dramatic declines, including disappearances within undisturbed habitat, which has been associated with chytridiomycosis as observed in many other montane, stream-associated species in the Andes. Climate change or the synergistic effects of multiple factors with chytridiomycosis could have also played a role in the declines. Chytridiomycosis has been associated with&#160;population declines of congeners throughout the Andes, and has been detected in congeners&#160;near Cusco in Peru (Seimon<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2005), as well as the area where this&#160;species&#160;occurs (Catenazzi&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011). Specimens collected in 1999 have tested positive for the amphibian chytrid fungus,<em>&#160;Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis&#160;</em>(Burrowes and De la Riva 2017).","This appears to have been a common species in Peru in the 1990s. Rangers of Parque Nacional Manu frequently found&#160;<em>Telmatobius&#160;</em>frogs (likely corresponding to this species) at a small spring near the Qurqurpampa station prior to June 2008 (35 km NNW of Acjanaco), after which the species appears to have suddenly declined and can no longer be found (A. Catenazzi pers. comm. February 2014). The area of Abra Acjanaco has been surveyed from 1996–2016 (Catenazzi <em>et al.</em> 2011, A. Catenazzi pers. comm. April 2017).&#160;While the initial surveys were not designed to survey for&#160;<em>Telmatobius</em>&#160;frogs,&#160;they provide useful information on this frog's presence (A. Catenazzi pers. comm. April 2017). During the surveys, tadpoles of this species were observed daily in 1996 and 1998 (A. Catenazzi pers. comm. February 2014). In 1996, four individuals were found over the course of 12 person-days; in 1998,&#160;two individuals&#160;were found during&#160;18 person-days, and in 2007 and 2008 no individuals were recorded over 25 and 28 person-days, respectively (von May&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008). In addition, further intensive and targeted surveys conducted between 2009–2010 and 2012–2016 did not report any new records of tadpoles or adults (A. Catenazzi pers. comm. April 2017). However, additional and independent surveys were conducted in 2007 and 2008 in Santuario Nacional Megantoni and the area of Parque Nacional Manu (R. Gutiérrez pers. comm. October 2013). Of these surveys, a total of four adults were found in 2007 in <em>ca </em>400 m stretch of a stream, over four person-hours. That same year, volunteers at Megantoni found ca. 12 individuals at this same site and the Tambo Inca sector of&#160;Parque Nacional&#160;Manu, close to the border with Megantoni. In June 2008, ten 200-m transects in&#160;the hill streams of&#160;<span id=""result_box"" class="""" lang=""en"">Lorohuachana&#160;were surveyed by one person over an average of 1.5 hours per transect, with a total of two adult frogs and two larvae recorded in this period<span id=""result_box"" class="""" lang=""en"">&#160;[R.

Interviews with park rangers revealed that 16&#160;<em>Telmatobius</em>&#160;frogs (likely this species) were found dead at Nuevo Oriente (<em>ca</em> 50 km NNW of Acjanaco, close to the border with Megantoni) in July 2008 (L.

It appears to be a secretive species restricted to water-filled arboreal bromeliads, and it possibly has a mostly arboreal lifestyle.&#160;The holotype was in a fallen arboreal bromeliad, near a stream (De la Riva and Chaparro 2005). Subsequent specimens were found 6–8 m above the ground, always in bromeliads (Catenazzi and Lehr 2009). The single known adult female contained six eggs, each about 6.5 mm in diameter (Catenazzi and Lehr 2009). Embryos undergo direct development on the sides of the body of the female (Duellman and Trueb 2015).","In 2009,&#160;the chytrid fungus&#160;<em>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</em>&#160;was detected in this species at Kosñipata Valley, Manu National Park, with a prevalence of 33.3% (n=3) (Catenazzi&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011). Chytridiomycosis has been implicated in the drastic population declines in amphibian assemblages of the upper&#160;Manu National Park&#160;(Catenazzi&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011), so the potential impacts of chytrid infection on this species requires further investigation. Other than that, the major threats to the species are unknown.","In 2009, six individuals were captured during visual-encounter surveys in montane forests along the Paucartambo-Shintuya road in Kosñipata Valley, Manu National Park, a few kilometres from the type locality (Catenazzi and Lehr 2009).

It is a diurnal, terrestrial species, and breeding takes place in the humid leaf litter, with clutch sizes ranging from 4–9 eggs, and tadpoles are later transported into tree holes and phytotelm (water-holding plants) axils with small water pools, where they complete metamorphosis (Brown <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008). Captive breeding efforts suggest that when conditions are adequate females may lay multiple clutches a year  (Brown <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008). This frog does not appear to be tolerant to habitat disturbance associated to agricultural activities (J.L. Brown and E. Twomey pers. comm. July 2011).","In addition to illegal trade, this frog is threatened by extensive habitat loss given that much if its habitat is near human settlements, and the constant encroachment by small-holder farmers and agro-industry seeking to expand their farmland is  causing rapid deforestation, thus comprising a major threat to this species (Brown<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span> 2008, E. Twomey pers. comm. April 2013). Around the type locality of Sauce and other known localities (e.g. Chazuta) deforestation remains extensive and two of the sites where this species was found are on the verge of being destroyed (E. Twomey pers. comm. April 2013).","In the last three decades the subpopulation in the locality of Chazuta,  where smuggling operations have typically taken place, appears to have  experienced a dramatic decline. Subpopulations in other areas that seem  to be overlooked by illegal collectors appear to flourishing (Brown <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2008). The global population is considered to be severely fragmented given that its habitat is in fragmented patches, more than half of the individuals are in small and isolated patches, and the species' biology is not conducive to dispersal in between habitat patches (J.L. Brown pers. comm. July 2011, E. Twomey, pers. comm. April 2013). Approximately 20 individuals have been observed in the past few years (E. Twomey pers. comm.

Individuals have been found at night on the upper surfaces of leaves of trees or herbs, about 1.5–4.0 m above streams.&#160;Reproduction occur via larval development, where eggs are laid on vegetation and the larvae develop in streams. It is unclear as to whether or not it is tolerant of habitat disturbance.","Habitat destruction and degradation are the main threats to this species due to small-holder farming, logging, infrastructure development and human settlement. In southern Ecuador, mining activities are wreaking havoc on the species' habitat (Chicaiza and Yánez 2013, Mazabanda&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018, RAISG 2020). At this stage, it is not clear whether or not this species has experienced declines within pristine habitats.

Reproduction occurs by direct development with eggs hatching directly into froglets. One female was reported to give birth to 17 froglets, while another female was found to contain eight oviductal eggs&#160;(Duellman <em>et al</em>. 2011).","It appears that subpopulations have declined from the mid 90s to early 2000s, when an outbreak of chytridiomycosis caused declines of several sympatric species within the region (A.

The chytrid fungus <em>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</em> has been reported from the Kosñipata Valley and has been confirmed in one juvenile specimen of this species in January 2009 (Catenazzi <em>et al</em>. 2011). Fourteen other specimens captured in July 2007, February and October 2008, and February 2009 were negative for the fungus (Catenazzi <em>et al</em>. 2011). In another study, four specimens collected from the Kosñipata Valley tested positive for <em>Bd </em>(prevalence = 25%), though all frogs had low infection loads (Burkart 2015). Previous work exposed both <em>G. nebulanastes</em> and <em>G. excubitor</em> to high numbers of zoospores in <em>Bd</em> susceptibility trials.

Based on the best supporting evidence, this species qualifies for Critically Endangered because its estimated EOO is 16 km<sup>2</sup>, it occurs at one threat-defined location, and there is a continuing decline in the area and quality of its habitat due to damming and regulation of streams, large-scale infrastructure projects, and contamination from mining and agriculture, as well as, an ongoing decline in the number of mature individuals likely due to chytridiomycosis. Should this species be recorded more widely than currently known, it may warrant listing in a less threatened category.</p>","The type locality is a&#160;high-elevation stream <em>c</em>. 10 m wide, with a rocky substrate that alternates pebble and gravel pools with small waterfalls and riffles, and is surrounded by puna (Catenazzi <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).&#160;As with other congeners, it is presumed to breed by larval development in water.&#160;During a field study, tadpoles were observed in various developmental stages, suggesting that the species is breeding successfully over extended periods of time, including during the dry season (Catenazzi <em>et al. </em>2015).","The&#160;pathogenic fungus&#160;<em>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis&#160;</em>has been detected from individuals at the type locality.&#160;In 2012, the prevalence of infection&#160;was 53.5% for tadpoles (n = 43), 40.0% for adults (n = 5) and the only juvenile found was infected (Catenazzi&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015). Additional threats to the species include the damming and regulation of streams, large-scale infrastructure projects (reservoirs, pipelines, roads, etc.) and contamination from mining and agriculture (Catenazzi <em>et al. </em>2015).&#160;The stream at the type locality is at the crossing with the highway connecting the coastal Panamerican highway to the city of Ayacucho and <em>c</em>. 500 m downstream of the type locality, the stream has been dammed to build a reservoir. The habitat downstream of the reservoir is not suitable for this species, although the reach upstream extends up to 4,300 m asl and could be used by the species for reproduction (Catenazzi <em>et al. </em>2015).","The population is suspected to be decreasing due to ongoing decline in the quality and extent of its habitat, and there is likely an ongoing decline of mature individuals due to chytridiomycosis.&#160;In October 2012, three observers searched 100 m of a stream reach for 60 min and encountered 43 tadpoles, one juvenile, and seven adults (Catenazzi <em>et al</em>. 2015).",Decreasing,"<p>This species is known only from the type locality: Chicchobamba,&#160;a stream tributary of the Huaytará river,&#160;which is in the upper&#160;drainage of the Pisco River watershed, Huaytará Province, Region of Huancavelica, in central Peru, where it occurs at 3,900 m asl. In the case of extent of occurrence (EOO), the lower bound is 16 km<sup>2</sup>, representing a minimum convex polygon of the species' estimated geographic range based on known records and immediate suitable habitat. The valley of the type locality and adjacent valleys are dominated by arid environments that likely limit dispersal of this species, thus it is very likely that it is endemic to the upper Pisco watershed and adjacent river basins (Catenazzi <em>et al. </em>2015).

Cochabamba, it was common at the end of the 1990s, but in the mid-2000s the population apparently declined, even within suitable habitat which is suggestive of chytridiomycosis. However, it seems as though the population is recovering because as of 2015 it was found in similar abundances as the 1990s&#160;and has remained at those levels (Bolivia Red List Assessment Workshop 2019). Regular surveys between 2006-2009, 2014-2015 and 2018-2019 have documented the species in Parque Nacional Carrasco (R. Aguayo, T. Camacho Badani, O. Quinteros and G. Calapa pers. comm. September 2019). As of 2019, the species is considered common throughout its Bolivian range (J. Aparicio pers. comm.

It has also been recorded from arable areas. Breeding takes place in the wet season in temporary ponds, peatlands, altiplano lagoons, slow flowing streams, and commonly in artificial wetlands, such as pools or ditches (D. Ferrer pers. comm. September 2017). No tadpoles have been found during the dry season (R. Santa Cruz pers. comm. July 2015).&#160;Some aspects of reproductive biology, larval behavior, phenotypic plasticity and thermal physiology of the larvae have been studied in southern subpopulations (Sympson <em>et al</em>. 2006, Jara <em>et al</em>. 2006, 2007;&#160;Navas <em>et al</em>. 2010, Perotti <em>et al</em>. 2011).","There are no major threats to this widespread and somewhat adaptable species; there are some localized declines through the use of agro-chemicals and over collection for educational use (dissections) at universities. In Chile and Argentina, it is threatened by hydroelectric dams, mining activities, unregulated tourism, livestock and overgrazing, road construction in fragile areas, peatlands desiccation, urbanization, and water pollution. In Peru, it is used for food and medicine; and the main observed threats in the habitat are grazing livestock (including llamas, alpacas, sheep), introduced trout species into the streams, and the destruction and pollution of bogs (R. Santa Cruz pers. comm. July 2015). In Bolivia, it is used for as part of spiritual practices.

While surveys have been carried out, the methods used (Visual Encounter Surveys and transects) are sufficient for reporting the species' presence, but do not provide adequate information on abundance as the species is aquatic (R. Santa Cruz pers. comm. July 2015). Local inhabitants in Peru have suggested that this species has declined dramatically compared to the 1990s (R. Santa Cruz pers. comm. July 2015). In Bolivia, this species used to be very common in the 1990s; however, it has experienced declines since the early to mid 2000s. It is still found in drier parts of its range and appears to be recovering, but occurs in lower abundances compared to historically.

It is frequently found under rocks close to small seasonal waterbodies and peat bogs, or at the sides of streams (Cortez 2001). It has also been found under rocks and in or around ponds formed by glacial melt and cushion bogs. It breeds explosively in slow-moving streams and small ponds. It is present in irrigated agricultural land.","This species appears to have undergone rapid, dramatic declines, including disappearances within undisturbed habitat, which has been associated with chytridiomycosis as observed in many other montane, stream-associated species in the Andes. Climate change or the synergistic effects of multiple factors could have played a role in the declines. The species is still being recorded at some sites, but in much lower numbers than historically. It is possible that&#160;the chytrid fungus,&#160;<em>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis&#160;</em>(<em>Bd</em>)&#160;may have been implicated in reported mortality events and declines reported by local farmers in Peru (von May&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2008, Catenazzi&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). Specimens have tested positive for <em>Bd </em>in Peru&#160;(Seimon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007, Catenazzi&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011), although&#160;Seimon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;(2007) noted that individuals did not appear to exhibit  clinical signs of chytridiomycosis.&#160;Bolivian specimens collected in 2001 and 2013 also tested positive for <em>Bd</em> (Burrowes and De la Riva 2017).<br/><br/>In both Ayacucho and Apurimac Regions of Peru, the habitat of this species is threatened by fires to generate and maintain pastures for livestock (V. Vargas pers. comm. 2014). The effects of climate change (e.g., droughts; decreasing humidity, precipitation and glacial cover) are also considered to pose an ongoing and future threat to this species (Bolivia Red List Assessment Workshop 2019).","It is generally a locally common species. In Chile, it has several fragmented subpopulations with low densities (Fíbla&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). It is a rarely recorded species in Argentina but this is likely&#160;related to the difficulty in accessing their habitat. In Bolivia, it was a locally common species in the 1990s, but it experienced population declines in the early 2000s; as of 2019, it is still being recorded in some sites, but in lower densities than historically (Bolivia Red List Assessment Workshop 2019).<br/><br/>In Peru, 2,619 tadpoles and adults were found over four person/days&#160;in 2005,&#160;while in 2008, 187 tadpoles and adults were recorded over four person/days (von May<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2008). Most of the&#160;2005 records were tadpoles in ponds.&#160;The number of tadpoles in 2008 was severely reduced, and local farmers reported finding both dead individuals and a population decline over the previous five years in Marcapata, Cusco (von May <em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).&#160;Observations of widespread severe declines and dead individuals within the Peruvian subpopulations have been made and reports from local farmers have stated that frogs that were once present have disappeared (A.

154334814,57349,Telmatobius marmoratus,Endangered,A2acde,2020,2019-09-25 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Listed as Endangered because of a population decline of at least 50% over the last three generation lengths (18 years; 2001–2019) due to the synergistic effects of chytridiomycosis, habitat loss and degradation, climate change, and over-harvesting (Bolivia Red List Assessment Workshop 2019).","It is a riparian, semi-aquatic frog of streams, waterfalls and slow moving water in montane grasslands and shrublands.&#160;It can be found at the edge of the lake, in streams and ponds created by deglaciation, and bogs.&#160;Breeding takes place in small lakes, streams and rivers with good water quality. It has also been observed to reproduce in both wet and dry seasons, using high elevation bogs (R. Santa Cruz pers. comm. July 2015).","This or a closely related species is currently subject to human consumption in southern Peru and Bolivia (Angulo 2008, Bolivia Red List Assessment Workshop 2019), and it is susceptible to water extraction, eutrophication and pollution of waterways through agricultural activities (livestock and agrochemicals) and domestic use. It is not currently threatened in Chile.<br/><br/>The species has tested positive for <em>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</em>&#160;(<em>Bd</em>) infection (Seimon <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2005, 2006) in the Cordillera Vilcanota of southern Peru and specimens exhibited clinical symptoms of chytridiomycosis. Healthy specimens, however, were found in the region of Puno, also in southern Peru, during fieldwork conducted in February 2006 (I. De la Riva pers. comm.). There is evidence of upward range expansion of this and another two anuran species to newly available habitat brought about by recent deglaciation in the Andes of Peru. The large increase in the upper limit of known&#160;<em>Bd</em>&#160;infections (from 4,112–5,348 m asl) also expands the spatial domain of potential&#160;<em>Bd</em>&#160;pathogenicity (Seimon <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2007).&#160;Specimens collected from Bolivia during 1980–2002 also tested positive <em>Bd</em> (Burrowes and De la Riva 2017).&#160;The effects of climate change (e.g., droughts and decreasing precipitation and humidity) are also considered to pose a serious future threat to the species (Bolivia Red List Assessment Workshop 2019).","In Peru, it is locally common, although declines have been reported for the population of Lake Sibinacocha (Seimon <em>et al</em>. 2006). Population surveys carried out from 2003–2009 have recorded fewer individuals from 2005 onwards.&#160;In&#160;2008,&#160;3-day surveys in Lake Sibinacocha by T. Seimon did not record a single individual; however, over the course of 10 days in 2009 two individuals were found by the same researcher (A. Catenazzi pers. comm. January 2010).&#160;There is a risk that this species may become locally extirpated at Sibinacocha.&#160;In the province of Chucuito, Puno, there was a reasonable number of individuals up until March 2010 (C. Aguilar pers. comm. January 2011).&#160;<br/><br/>In Bolivia, this species was formerly very common in the 1980s and 1990s (I. de La Riva pers. comm. September 2019). Declines in the humid parts of its Bolivian range were observed during the early 2000s; while these areas represent a relatively small proportion of the distribution, they represent a high proportion of the population because the conditions are more favourable for the species (Bolivia Red List Assessment Workshop 2019). It has completely disappeared from some Bolivian sites (e.g., Cooco), while in other sites it is now found in much lower abundances than historically (Bolivia Red List Assessment Workshop 2019).<br/><br/>In Chile, the species is reported to have large subpopulations, and to be abundant in high plateau streams; although these subpopulations represent a small proportion of the population.<br/><br/>It is estimated that the population overall has experienced a decline of more than 50% over the last three generation lengths (18 years; 2001–2019) due to the synergistic effects of chytridiomycosis, habitat loss and degradation, climate change, and over-harvesting (Bolivia Red List Assessment Workshop 2019).",Decreasing,"This species has the broadest distribution of any <em>Telmatobius</em> species. It is known from the Andean region of southern Peru, northern and central Bolivia and northern Chile. It is recorded in Peru from the Lake Titicaca and Cusco areas, with uncertain records from Ayacucho (not mapped). In Bolivia, it is recorded from the departments of La Paz, Oruro, and northern Potosi (I. De la Riva pers. comm. September 2019). It is present in the altiplano of northern Chile (Parinacota, Lauca River, and Chungara Lake, Parinacota Province), and its range has recently been extended southwards to Cancosa (Tarapacá region; Sáez <em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;It occurs from 1,800-5,244 m asl.&#160;Records from Argentina, on the Bolivian border, likely belong to <em>Telmatobius rubigo</em>. The subpopulations reported from the highlands of Cochabamba, Bolivia probably actually refer to <em>Telmatobius hintoni</em> (I. De la Riva pers. comm.

The establishment of large livestock grazing  areas is identified as the main mechanism of habitat fragmentation in the vicinity of Yanachaga Chemillén National Park. Illegal logging inside the Oxapampa-Asháninka-Yánesha Biosphere Reserve, as well as&#160;migratory agriculture and unsustainable use of agrochemicals are also threats (UNESCO 2016).

It is not found in areas disturbed by human activity (Brown<em> et al.</em> 2008). It is diurnal and, at least partially, a terrestrial species, where reproduction (clutches of 4–6 eggs) has been observed within the humid leaf litter. Tadpoles are then transported to water-filled bromeliads, where they complete development (Brown <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008).","This species occurs in areas that are&#160;being&#160;actively farmed and logged, primarily for subsistence farming, logging and agroindustry (J. Brown pers. comm. July 2011), which will reduce the amount of suitable habitat substantially over the coming years (Brown <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2008). While it appears that much of its habitat is undisturbed, it is estimated that between 5–15% of subpopulations are currently being impacted by human-induced deforestation, possibly leading to slow declines (J. Brown pers. comm. July 2011, February 2013). In addition, it has recently (2007) been illegally exported for the  international pet trade, with legally-acquired individuals recorded in  2009 (J.

The projection that there will be a high demand for this species in the pet trade  (Brown <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2008) seems to be confirmed in the area surrounding Shucushuyacu, where smuggling pressure has increased considerably, to such an extent that no individuals have been seen in the wild in this area since the species was described (J. Brown pers. comm. July 2011). It is suspected that local inhabitants may be felling trees to collect these frogs for the black market, impacting not only this species but others that share the same environment (J.

It appears to live in fragmented habitat patches and the species is considered to have a poor dispersal ability (J. Brown pers. comm. February 2013). It is suspected, based on its association with arboreal habitat, that some of the subpopulations may be undergoing declines due to human-induced deforestation (J. Brown pers. comm. February 2013). For example, at the type locality Shucushuyacu, about half a dozen visits between 2008-2012 did not record this species suggesting these local collections for the legal pet trade may be affecting the subpopulation there (J.

The Pampas del Sacramento are bound by the Cordillera Azul and Río Huallaga to the west, Río Ucayali to the east, and the flooded forests of Pacaya-Samiria to the north (J. Brown and E. Twomey pers. comm. July 2011). The southern margin of its range likely extends at least to Rio Cushabatay, but not reaching Pucallpa, as frequent surveys along the Aguaytia-Pucallpa road since 2006 have failed to encounter any individuals (Brown <em>et al</em>. 2008).

Since that time the condition of Lake Titicaca has worsened and population declines in this species are not only suspected to have taken place, but are ongoing and expected to continue into the future due to over-exploitation, habitat degradation resulting from water extraction and sedimentation, and domestic, industrial and agricultural water pollution, predation by introduced species,&#160;and the potential effects of chytrid fungus. In some areas of the lake, mainly in the Lago Menor of the Bolivian side, more than 90% of the population has disappeared. Using the time frame of the previous assessment starting in 1994, we estimate that over three generation lengths (42 years; 1994–2036) the population will undergo a decline of at least 50%. The generation length has been revised since the 2004 assessment from five years to 14 years based on an improved understanding of the species’ biology; however, due to the nature and severity of the threats that this species faces and observed ongoing population declines, it is believed that this is a defensible and reasonable estimate.<br/><br/><strong>Reason for the change in status:</strong><br/>In 2004, this species was assessed as Critically Endangered based on an estimate of an 80% population decline in the previous ten years (1994–2004). The generation length has been revised since the 2004 assessment from five years to 14 years based on an improved understanding of the species’ biology.<br/><br/>It is evident that the population is declining at an accelerated rate, thereby triggering a threatened category under criterion A. However, a lack of systematic surveys across the lake makes it difficult to accurately assess population sizes and rate of decline. Many different population estimates exist, but different methods were used and surveys were performed at different times of the year. With the initial population size estimates being very high (50–75 million individuals), a decline of 30–50% in such an abundant species over three generation lengths (42 years) would probably go unnoticed and therefore would probably represent an underestimate. On the other hand,&#160;80% decline is likely too high an estimate, as it would be difficult to justify the large numbers of individuals still extant in the lake. Considering the disparate population information and all of the threats to the species, it is thought that the population is very likely to experience a decline of at least 50% (but probably less than 80%) over three generations. Due to the uncertainty in the data, this reassessment takes a precautionary approach in the Endangered A4acde listing; it is believed that this is a defensible and reasonable estimate.</p>","It is an entirely aquatic species. Adults appear to prefer muddy or sandy areas with rocks and vegetation, while juveniles exhibit a strong preference for rocky habitats (Genova 2011). Its diet is diverse, but primarily consists of gastropods and crustaceans (Pérez 1998). Reproduction occurs in shallow waters close to Lake Titicaca's shoreline,&#160;in submerged aquatic vegetation (<em>Elodea sp.</em>), at depths between 2–15 m (Genova 2011, Flores 2013). In a year-long analysis by Pérez (1998), it has been determined that the species is able to reproduce all year, although they have been seen in amplexus only in winter months (May–November).&#160;There is variation throughout the year in the number of eggs per clutch: 115 eggs were recorded during the month of May, 777–866 eggs during October and 941 eggs during February (Pérez 1998).&#160;More recent data recorded between 200 and 500 eggs in the wild (A. Muñoz pers. comm. March 2016). In captivity, clutch size varies from 23–450 eggs in Peru (Pérez Bejar 2002, 2005; L. Bermudez pers. comm.) to 173–475 eggs in Bolivia (A. Muñoz pers. comm. March 2016).&#160;Eggs are placed in groups of 20–50 eggs on aquatic plants in different areas. Metamorphosis takes about four months (Pérez Bejar 2005).&#160;The generation length is estimated to be 14 years (Bolivia Red List Assessment Workshop September 2019).","Major threats include unregulated over-harvesting of adults (Lehr 2000, Angulo 2008a, Herzog 2009, Rodrigues 2013, Zevallos&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016,&#160;SERFOR 2018a,b), water extraction and sedimentation, and domestic, industrial and agricultural water pollution (Pérez 2009, Monroy <em>et al</em>. 2014, Beltrán Farfán <em>et al.</em> 2015, MMAyA 2015). The pollution problem is exacerbated in the area of five municipalities in the basin in Bolivia: El Alto, Viachan, Laja, Pucarani and Puerto Perez, whose populations discharge their effluents and waste in Lago Menor across the&#160;Cohana&#160;Bay. The provinces of Carabaya, Melgar, Azángaro, Putina and Huancané on the Peruvian side do not have efficient treatment of wastewater, which enters directly into rivers. In addition, livestock is prominent throughout the region, including the buffer zone of the Titicaca National Reserve.&#160;The sediments of Lago Menor have levels of contamination beyond the limits for chromium, copper, iron, lead, zinc and arsenic (MMAyA 2015). Additionally, in the headwaters of the Río Ramis, Río Coata and Río Illpa in the Department of Puno, Peru, mining is occurring in the Cordillera Carabaya.&#160;In general, there has been a severe loss of suitable aquatic habitat, especially in areas where reproduction occurs. There have been massive die-offs in parts of its range in 2009, 2011, 2013, 2015 and 2016 (A. Muñoz pers. comm. March 2016; SERFOR 2016).&#160;In April 2015, a significant die-off event occurred in an area greater than 500 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;at Lago Menor on the Bolivian side, primarily caused by the combination of an algae bloom and the release of hydrogen sulfide from the bottom of the lake which completely cut off oxygen to the frogs&#160;(Pérez 2015, A. Muñoz pers. comm. February 2016). In October 2016, an estimated 10,000 individuals were found dead on the Peruvian side of the lake, concentrated along a&#160;50 km stretch of the Coata River,&#160;with increased sewage runoff as the most likely culprit (SERFOR 2016).<br/><br/>Burrowes and De la Riva (2017) document the presence of&#160;<em>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</em>&#160;(<em>Bd</em>) in the species as early as 1863 (the oldest record of <em>Bd</em> hitherto in the world). Individuals&#160;from wild subpopulations of both countries, as well as captive specimens from markets in Cusco and Lima, have been found to be infected with the chytrid fungus,&#160;<em>B. dendrobatidis </em>(Berenguel&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015, Berenguel <em>et al</em>. 2016,&#160;Zevallos <em>et al. </em>2016, Lay 2017, SERFOR 2019) and ranavirus (A. Muñoz pers. comm. 2015). It is possible that the chytrid fungus is being spread through illegal trade (Catenazzi <em>et al</em>. 2010,&#160;Zevallos&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Because this frog performs all gas exchange through its skin, <em>Bd</em> is particularly detrimental to its health (Berenguel&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016). The presence of <em>Saprolegnia</em> fungi and co-infection with ranavirus is also a potential threat (Martin-Torrijos <em>et al</em>. 2016, Warne <em>et al</em>. 2016).&#160;<br/><br/>In Peru, there are many legitimate trout concessions in Lake Titicaca geared primarily for external consumption (A. Catenazzi pers. comm. January 2011), in addition to informal aquaculture activities. There is evidence of predation of amphibian larvae by introduced species in Lake Titicaca, including Rainbow Trout (<em>Oncorhynchus mykiss</em>) and Pejerrey (<em>Odontesthes bonariensis</em>), in addition to competition between these species for space and food (Aguilar <em>et al</em>. 2010, E. Richard pers. obs. 2010, Martin-Torrijos <em>et al</em>. 2016). The high numbers of aquaculture sites give reason to suspect that high concentrations of trout may also bring in some of their associated risks. Additional threats include contamination of the lake from motorboat fuel, temperature increase from climate change and bycatch from fisheries (SERNANP 2015).&#160;The negative effects of climate change include increasing evaporation and temperature (which could make <em>Bd </em>more virulent; Muñoz<em> et al.</em> 2018), decreasing discharge of streams and glaciers into lakes, as well as, potential loss of breeding habitat (Bolivian Red List Assessment Workshop 2019).<p></p>","It was previously common, but has experienced massive population declines and is now threatened. In 1994, it was estimated that there were about 75 million individuals in Lake Titicaca (Morawetz 1994 in Pacheco 1997). In February 2001 (wet season), visual counting along 53 transects at eight locations of the Peruvian side of the lake revealed an estimate of 26.5 million individuals in the Peruvian side of the lake and 51 million individuals for the entire lake (BTA-Peru 2002b). A similar survey performed at 16 locations during July–August 2001 (dry season) estimated the population size to be nine million individuals in the Peruvian side of the lake and 17 million individuals for the entire lake (BTA-Peru 2002b).&#160;In Bolivia, the relative abundance of this species in Lago Menor, based on the average number of frogs found at different depths (1–10 m) by divers, has been estimated at 80 individuals/km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Pérez Bejar 2002).&#160;<br/><br/>While many earlier population estimates assumed that the frogs were evenly distributed throughout the lake, more recent estimates are unable to extrapolate densities around the lake with any level of confidence. Given that the&#160;lake is so large and has different types of habitats, it is difficult to obtain a reliable census.&#160;Based on interviews in 2009, 68% of respondents indicated that it is more difficult to find large frogs now than it was previously, an indication that the proportion of individuals that successfully reach adulthood is low, and survival success also appears to be lower (Cortez <em>et al</em>. 2009). Information provided by local fishermen suggests that wild populations have declined (Pérez Bejar 2002, 2005).&#160;In 2011, distance sampling surveys at six localities in the north-west portion of Copacabana Peninsula estimated 575,000 adult individuals/km<sup>2</sup> and 1,630,000 juveniles/km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Genova 2011).&#160;During 2009–2016, population monitoring suggests there have been local population declines in both Lago Mayor (Isla de la Luna) and Lago Menor (Guaqui) (A. Muñoz pers. comm. March 2016). During surveys on the Bolivian side of the lake, about 3% of the population was found dead (A . Muñoz pers. comm. March 2016). There have been mass mortality events in the Lago Menor area in 2009, 2011 and 2015. One month after the April 2015 mortality event, surveys of Lago Menor revealed 106 dead individuals in less than five minutes (A. Munoz pers. comm. 2015). October 2015 surveys between Puerto Pérez and the Island of Suriqui revealed no living individuals, despite frogs being present in the area prior to the event.&#160;In an area of about 300 km<sup>2</sup> in Lago Menor, where previously the species was relatively common, 100% of frogs were dead; however, in a small area of Lago Menor, adult frogs and breeding activity, can still be observed (Muñoz and Johnson 2017).&#160;There are other areas where adult frogs are absent and it appears that only juveniles or young adults are present (Muñoz and Johnson 2017). Another mass mortality event occurred in October 2016, this time on the Peruvian side of the lake, where an estimated 10,000 individuals were found dead (SERFOR 2016).&#160;The population structure is typically made up of 60% subadults and small adult frogs, 30% metamorphs and juveniles, and 5% big adults, however, this depends on the area (A. Munoz pers. comm.&#160;February 2016).<br/><br/>It is thought that the population will have declined by more than 50% over three generation lengths (42 years; 1994–2036)&#160;due to the synergistic effects of habitat loss and degradation, over-harvesting, climate change, and&#160;chytridiomycosis (Bolivia Red List Assessment Workshop 2019).",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to Lake Titicaca on the border of Peru and Bolivia. It has also been found in the neighbouring Lago&#160;Saracocha,&#160;Lago&#160;Umayo, Lago Chajchora, Laguna Arapa, Río Ilave, and&#160;Laguna de Alonso (E. Ramos pers. comm. 2018). It occurs at an elevation of 3,810 m asl, and its extent of occurrence (EOO) is 18,563 km<sup>2</sup>, which represents a single threat-defined location.","This species is captured for food and for use in medicinal products. The medicinal use includes use as an aphrodisiac and to treat various ailments, such as memory loss, impotence and asthma, in Peru and Bolivia. It is traded whole and fresh, desiccated (Lehr 2000, Angulo 2008a, Herzog 2009,&#160;Zevallos&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016), as leather, as a juice or as flour (Lehr 2005, Reading <em>et al</em>. 2011). According to SERFOR of Puno, the new form of trafficking is the sale of dry frogs, which are more difficult to detect in their inspections. The consumption of the frog occurs in various forms; in Lima the frogs are prepared and consumed in the frog ""shake"" (Lehr 2000), while in Cusco frogs are consumed mainly in soup form (Angulo 2008a). The hips and legs of the frog are offered to tourists, mostly foreigners, as an ""exotic"", local dish in restaurants throughout parts of San Pedro de Tiquina, Huatajata, Copacabana, and La Paz, Bolivia (C. Cortez pers. comm, A. Muñoz pers. comm. February 2016, R. Elias pers. comm. 2018). A 2002 report focused on increasing the local demand of Titicaca Water Frog meat in restaurants and tourism areas, as well as on developing new marketing strategies to promote the high-protein product, including canning of frog legs in tomato sauce and a proposed slogan: ""Si visita Puno y el lago Titicaca, consuma la Rana Gigante del Lago"" (BTA-Peru 2002c). In 2006, an analysis of 28 communities surrounding Lake Titicaca determined a total of 27,548 frogs are consumed each year (Alvarez 2006). According to Rodríguez (2013), an average of 3,354 frogs are extracted each month (40,248 frogs/year) for human consumption, as meat and traditional medicine, in Bolivia. It has been estimated that over 15,000 individuals/year are used in the preparation of frogs legs (Pérez 2009). In 2013, the Bolivian newspaper, <em>Opinión</em>, reported that frog juice is being marketed in the city of El Alto. There is a potential public health risk from exposure to&#160;<em>Salmonella</em> through the consumption or handling of this species; approximately 7% (n=30) of specimens tested positive for&#160;<em>Salmonella </em>(Villena and Enciso 2008).&#160;Stevey Edery (2015) from Cayetano Heredia University isolated three species of&#160;<em>Vibrio&#160;</em>(<em>V. cholerae, V. alginolyticus and V. fluvialis</em>) in the&#160;confiscated&#160;skins of this species in&#160;Lima, Peru.<br/><br/>In recent years, a higher demand for this frog in major cities is placing even greater pressure on the population. Trade has been reported from El Alto, Bolivia (C. Cortez pers. comm), as well as from market stands in Cusco and Lima, Peru (Angulo 2008a, Zevallos <em>et al.</em> 2016). In April 2005, a cargo of about 4,400 individuals destined for human consumption was confiscated from illegal traders at a large market in Lima (INRENA 2005, Lundberg 2006). Interviews with merchants in Bolivia revealed that approximately 3,500 individuals of this species are collected each month to sell in markets (Palacios 2013). While most commercial sale is for domestic consumption in Peru and Bolivia, there is evidence of international trade within Latin America (Reading&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011). Several cases of illegal hunting for export, mainly to markets in the US, Canada, Europe, Brazil and Japan, have been reported (Rodríguez&#160;2013). In 2008, there were reports of this species in the pet trade in Europe and in March 2016, six individuals were seized, four of which were going to Europe for the pet trade (A. Muñoz pers. comm. February 2016). According to Servicio Nacional Forestal y de Fauna Silvestre (SERFOR), between the years 2012–2015, more than 9,500 individuals have been seized in the regions of Puno, Arequipa and Lima (SERFOR unpubl. data). Considering the fact that this species is widely consumed in markets across the Andes and in Lima and that synergistic effects with other threats and declines are a real concern, it is possible that trade could have a significant impact on the global population of this species. In 2018, more than 500&#160;Titicaca Water Frogs were confiscated in two separate seizures in Puno; the frogs were being sold in markets in the city of Juliaca (SERFOR 2018a,b). In June 2019, more than 2,500&#160;Titicaca Water Frogs were confiscated by Servicio Nacional Forestal y de Fauna Silvestre (SERFOR), the National Police of Peru and Customs at the Pucusana checkpoint&#160;during a routine inspection of a bus heading to Lima. These frogs were illegally extracted from Puno and it is presumed that they would be distributed in Lima markets to be used in the preparation of frog extracts. Specimens tested positive for the chytrid fungus (SERFOR 2019).",Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<strong><em>Conservation Actions In-Place<br/></em></strong><em style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/>In situ</em><strong>&#160;actions<br/></strong>It is present in the Titicaca National Reserve (TNR), but it is insufficient for effective conservation. In the TNR, there are several environmental problems: a) poor solid waste disposal near Uros Chulluini, Carata, Kapy-Uros; b) dumping of sewage into the mouth of Río Coata; c) presence of cattle without authorization; and d) informal fishing in a stretch of the Río Huile (SERNANP 2012).<br/><br/>In 2007, Denver Zoo launched a project in coordination with the Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia (UPCH) to conserve the Titicaca Water Frog, which involves screening frogs for chytrid fungus and other diseases, genetic testing, assisting in surveys of the lake and markets, and an education campaign to change local attitudes and behaviours impacting the survival of this frog (Reading&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2011). In 2010, the first workshop was organized to develop the ""National Plan of Conservation Frog Titicaca in Peru"". Since 2012, Denver Zoo and the National Reserve of Titicaca signed a letter of understanding regarding the mutual interest of both institutions to develop research projects, monitoring and environmental education. In 2015, Denver Zoo and the Regional Government of Puno in Peru signed a memorandum of understanding to work together to monitor the Peruvian population of the species. Since 2016, Denver Zoo, along with Reserva Nacional del Titicaca, Gobierno Regional de Puno and the IUCN SSC Amphibian Specialist Group, is collaborating with the Technical Forest and Wildlife Management of Puno and the Municipality of Lima in a campaign to promote awareness about the illegal use of this species in medicinal extracts (Elias&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2017).<br/><br/>In 2015, a monitoring programme was established in different sites of Lake Titicaca that are monitored regularly (A. Muñoz pers. comm. 2019). In February 2016, a pilot project for the&#160;<em>ex situ</em>&#160;conservation of the species transferred 70 individuals from Lago Menor (Guaqui) and Lago Mayor (Isla de la Luna) to the facilities, and included research on the species' natural history, population status and effects of&#160;<em>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</em>.<br/><br/><em><strong>Ex situ</strong></em><strong>&#160;actions<br/></strong>While attempts at captive breeding were initially unsuccessful (Pérez Bajar 2005), efforts led by Denver Zoo, Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia (UPCH; Peru) and the Huachipa Zoological Park (HZP; Peru), have successfully produced captive-born individuals to be used primarily for awareness raising purposes. In addition, the Museo de Historia Natural Alcide D’Orbigny (Bolivia) have produced captive-born individuals, which are being held for conservation and reintroduction purposes (A. Muñoz pers. comm. February 2016). Captive breeding began in 2008 at the Laboratory of Wildlife UPCH from seized individuals; with the help of HZP in Lima, the first pair managed to successfully reproduce in 2010. In November 2015, Denver Zoo received 20 Lake Titicaca frogs from the HZP with the aim to study their behaviour and increase their numbers.<br/><br/><strong>Policy-based actions<br/></strong>In 2012, the government of Puno issued an ordinance declaring this species a tourist attraction in the Lake Titicaca region. Since 2016, priority has been given to actions aimed at promoting the conservation of the Titicaca Water Frog by the Peru-Bolivia Binational Ministerial Cabinets. Under this binational effort, the “Binational Action Plan for the Conservation of the Titicaca Water Frog (<em>Telmatobius culeus</em>) and the Titicaca Grebe (<em>Rollandia microptera</em>)” was jointly approved in 2018 [see Gabinete Binacional de Ministros Perú-Bolivia 2018, CITES 2019b]. The Plan provides for the development of priority actions to improve the conservation status of this species, including reducing illegal trafficking and controlling threats to the population, and promoting sustainable activities for local communities. In April 2019, the Peruvian government launched an initiative to construct 10 new wastewater treatment plants, which will replace a 40 year-old existing treatment plant. In a bilateral meeting in June 2019, the construction of another twelve wastewater treatment plants was confirmed on the Bolivian side of the lake, in addition to the two monitoring stations already installed (Chisleanschi 2019).<br/><br/>The species is listed as Critically Endangered (CR) in Peru and has legal protection provided by the Categorization in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna (Decreto Supremo Nº004-2014-MINAGRI), which bans all hunting, capture, possession, transport or export of the species for commercial purposes. Peru is in the process of approving the ""National Strategy Against Illegal Wildlife Trafficking in Peru"", which includes activities related to the trade of the Lake Titicaca Frog. It is also listed as Critically Endangered in Bolivia’s Red Book of Threatened Vertebrates (Aguayo 2009), included in Bolivia’s action plan for threatened amphibians (MMAyA 2012) and the Amphibian Need Assessment organized by Amphibian Ark. Additionally, it is protected under Bolivian Law 1333 which prohibits the use of wildlife, and the Action Plan for the Conservation of Threatened Amphibians of Bolivia (2013–2017). The species was included in CITES Appendix I at the 17th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to CITES (CoP17) held in September 2016.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><em>Conservation Needed</em></span><br/>Measures are needed to maintain and protect key breeding sites (Bolivia Red List Assessment Workshop 2019).&#160;Wastewater treatment plants are needed on both sides of the lake to mitigate negative impacts of sewage runoff on this frog.&#160;The enforcement of legislation is needed to address over-harvesting problems in this species. Both national and international mechanisms and the&#160;enactment of legislation that strictly prohibits the movement, possession and use of this species, or any of its products, parts or derivatives is imperative. It is crucial to undertake baseline and complementary studies to determine the impact of harvests on the population (Angulo 2008a) and constant monitoring of the species and its habitat is necessary. Establishment of protected areas and the enlargement of already established protected areas is essential for the conservation of this species (Genova 2011).<br/><br/><strong><em>Research Needed</em></strong><strong><em><br/></em></strong>More information is needed about this species' life history, population status, commercialization, and threats. Further studies should monitor trends in harvest levels. Given that <em>Bd</em> has been detected in this species, it should be monitored closely and studies assessing this species' tolerance and/or resistance to <em>Bd</em>&#160;are also warranted (Cossel <em>et al</em>. 2014). It is necessary to continue epidemiological studies regarding the potential public health risk this frog poses to its handlers and consumers, which might be used to discourage the utilization of the species. At the 18th&#160;meeting&#160;of the&#160;Conference of the Parties&#160;to&#160;CITES&#160;(CoP18) held in August 2019, a series of concrete actions were documented, urging Peru and Bolivia to collaborate in completing population studies of the species in Lake Titicaca&#160;and&#160;identifying and monitoring all international illegal trade of specimens&#160;(CITES 2019).",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

Although some of the populations in Europe of this species are increasing, other introductions not have become fully established. In Asia, it is only present in isolated pockets. Animals have been deliberately introduced to northern Thailand in the hope of augmenting native frog production. Farmed animals are exported alive to East Asia (Lim and Lim 1992, Pariyanonth and Daorerk 1995) and can escape or be released to become established.

Its native range is from Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, southern Quebec, Canada, south to eastern North America, except southern Florida, USA, then southward through Veracruz, Mexico. It is also found in northwestern Mexico in Sonora, Chihuahua, Baja California, Baja California Sur, Sinaloa and Durango, and probably other areas in Mexico, as well. This species was introduced to Mexico at the beginning of last century; nowadays it has reached central Mexico (up to Aguas Calientes, San Luis Potosí, Hidalgo, Mexico, Mexico D.F., Morelos, Puebla, Guerrero and Michoacán with state records). It was introduced to 'La Garita' in Costa Rica, but now appears to be extinct in this country (G.&#160; Chaves pers. comm.). It is also introduced in Cuba, Puerto Rico (introduced in 1935), Hawaii (introduced mid- to late 1800s, now on all main islands), Isla de la Juventud, Hispaniola (only confirmed in northern and eastern Dominican Republic, not in Haiti) and Jamaica. Its range is increasing in some areas. It is introduced to South America. In Venezuela, there is an expanding population in&#160;the surroundings of La Carbonera, Mérida State, at the Andean versants facing Lake Maracaibo basin (Barrio-Amorós <em>et al.</em> 2019). In Colombia it is known from the Middle Magdalena Valley, north to the lowlands on the Caribbean coast. It has also been found in Bogotá, although it is not known whether it has established a population there. In Peru it has become established around Iquitos in central Loreto Department in the Amazon Basin, and also around Lima on the Pacific coast. There are also a number of populations established in Ecuador and Brazil. It has been introduced in Rincón de Pando, Canelones, Uruguay, and in Misiones, Cordoba and San Juan provinces in Argentina (Sanabria <em>et al</em>. 2005,&#160;Pereyra&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2006,&#160;Akmentins and Pereyra 2009).
